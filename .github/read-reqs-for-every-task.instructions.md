# Task Requirements Guidelines

When performing any tasks (Agent mode, Edit mode, or answering questions in Ask mode):

1. **Carefully read and understand all requirements** before proceeding with any implementation or response.

2. **Expand the user request** based on the requirement documentation to ensure comprehensive understanding.

3. **Search the codebase** for relevant files and existing implementations that can be reused or referenced.

4. **Rethink the user request** and requirements to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the task.

5. **Refine the user request** based on the requirements and your understanding of the codebase.

6. **Follow the established architecture design** - do not deviate from the project's architectural patterns.

7. **Prioritize existing files** - do not create new files if the functionality can be appropriately implemented in existing ones.

8. **Maintain code consistency** with the existing codebase regarding style, patterns, and naming conventions.

9. **Ask for clarification** if any requirements seem ambiguous or contradictory.

10. **Document your changes** by explaining your implementation decisions when appropriate.
